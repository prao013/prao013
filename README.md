### Hi, I'm Suhas here ðŸ‘‹

I am an avid experimenter and seek opportunities to learn and work on new fields in my spare time. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at University of California, Riverside. I am doing my Directed Research under the guidance of Dr. Zhijia Zhao at UCR.

I am a Software Developer with 4+ years of experience who loves coding, solving problems and designing software. Over the last four years, as part of the Software Development team, I made critical contributions to the Finance Solutions developed by SAP. Apart from personal projects in Compiler design and Machine Learning.

Personally, I'm a staunch proponent of the Growth Mindset and strongly believe that technical skills coupled with perseverance can enable us to solve any complex problem.
